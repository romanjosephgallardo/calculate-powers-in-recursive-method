A teacher named Mrs. Rivera who loved making math fun for her students. 
One day, a student named Mia asked how to calculate powers, like (2^7). 
Mrs. Rivera explained, “Imagine you need to multiply 2 by itself seven times. 
We can solve this using a python code utilizing  special method called recursion 
to solve this,” Can you help the class of Mrs. Rivera by providing the recursive 
method to calculate powers?

# pseudocode

# code here
# Get user input of base and power
base = int(input("Enter the base number:"))
power = int(input("Enter the power: "))

# Define calculate powers function
# Call the function
# Print the result
